# WildBerryEye
WildBerryEye leverages Raspberry Pi and YOLO object detection models to monitor pollinizers like bees and hummingbirds visiting flowers. This initiative aims to enhance environmental research by automating data collection and analysis of pollinator activities, which are crucial for ecological assessments and conservation efforts.
